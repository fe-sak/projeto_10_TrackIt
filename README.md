- [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed for cloning the project and managing source code changes. You must also configure your git tool for connecting to GitHub using ssh. [The official GitHub guides](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- Nodejs installed. It is recommended to use a version manager, such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- A IDE for coding. The most popular one is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
